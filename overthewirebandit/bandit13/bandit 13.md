Pass:- MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

This level was a biiit tough for me at he begining as i had no clue of what to do 

do i have to find the password , but the question says we dont have to use pass to login to the next level

i logged in and then read and the ssh.private file (that when used file command says the file as

PEM:RSA private key

i got this but i have 
no idea what to with it 

i searched for a ways to logging into ssh without using passwords

finally i found you can log in using 

ssh key authentication 

read through some resources 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell (although this didn't help me much )

https://www.webhi.com/how-to/how-to-use-a-private-key-for-ssh-authentication/ (and this was where it finally clicked )

followed through the resource and made a public private key pair using ssh-keygen as a kind of test and that when i finally understood how this is supposed to work (as the generated the private key is the same PEM:RSA private key)

i just copy pasted the contents of  ssh.private to id_rsa file in ~/.ssh dir after erasing its previous contents 

and there it is when i tried to log in to the next level again i was able to log in without a pass 

and for the pass  i retrieved it from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

and there it is MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS is the pass
